I want to make a nft marketplace website, which displays nfts for sale:

the marketplace will have a database of available nfts by their id, name and images.

users can browse through the collections available for sale.

users can add the ones they like and would want to buy to cart.

users can add to wishlist the ones they like but cant buy to their cart.

users can post their email for newsletters from the marketplace.

users can search for keyword of the names of the nft to bring up the exact one they would like to view instead of scrolling through the website.

users can view their cart and wishlist and delete what they dont want from the cart and wishlist.
